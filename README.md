## Introduction

Work In Progress üöß  
This repository contains the code for a Rails API only app that is used as the backend for my DailyJourney project.
The project goal is to put people in contact in order to share their cars for their daily travels, such as commuting to go to their workplace.
This project also has a frontend made witn Angular 10 (WIP). [DailyJourney Frontend](https://github.com/egimenos/dailyjourney)

## Setup and Installation

The project it's being built with these tools:

- Ruby version `2.7.1`
- Rails version `6.03`
- PostgreSQL 12

1. You need to make sure that the tools are properly installed in your system. The steps to follow are different depending on your system but you can find great guides for all of them in the guides section of GoRails, by Chris Oliver, just select your operating system: https://gorails.com/setup/
2. Once the tools are installed, clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/EGimenoS/dailyjourneyapi.git`
3. Move to the project root folder and install the dependencies by using `bundle install`
4. Create the database: `rails db:createe`
5. Run the database migration: `rails db:migrate`
6. Start your development server `rails s`

The app needs a Here Maps apikey to work since it uses their Geocoding and Search REST API v7. You can get a key for free with a generous free tier. More instructions: https://developer.here.com/documentation/geocoding-search-api/dev_guide/index.html.

Once you get your key, set it as an ENV variable. You can use for instance the figaro gem bundled with this project gemfile, run `bundle exec figaro install` to generate an `application.yml` file and add a new key with a here_maps_api_key and the value of your new key.

If you prefer to use a different provider than Here, add your own adapter to the Adapter module `app/adapters/adapter`

### Seeding the database.

To generate consistent seed data the Faker gem along with Geocoder is used. You can directly run `rails db:seed` to seed the data or modify the file `./db/seeds.rb` to adjust the seed configuration.

## Endpoints

> Asuming your are running your app in `http://localhost:3000`

### User creation

Body:

```
 { "email": "testuser@test.com",
	"password": "testpassword" ,
	"password_confirmation": "testpassword",
	"name": "Test User" }
```

If the sign up is successful the response contains an access token in the response header that needs to be included later in the header of all the requests made against any protected resources.

### User login

Signs in an existing user

`POST` request to `http://localhost:3000/users/sign_in`

Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`

Body:

```
 { "email": "testuser@test.com",
	"password": "testpassword"  }
```

If the sign in is successful the response contains an access token in the response header that needs to be included later in the header of all the requests made against protected resources.

### New Travel creation.

		"longitude": "2",
		"latitude": "1"
	}
}

### Autosuggest addresses

It receives a string as a query and suggests real addresses from the Here Maps API. It is used to implement an input search with suggestions to validate real addreses and provide longitude and latitude values.

`GET` request to `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/search_addresses`

Query parameters:

```
q: query string to lookup
at: Specifies the center of the search context. Format: {latitude},{longitude}
```

Example: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/search_addresses?at=39.48728,-0.36593&q=lagranja%201%20almusafes`

Response:

It returns an array with several items that might match the query, including the proper address and the latitude and longitude values.

```
[
  {
    "address": "Calle La Granja, 1, 46440 Almussafes (Valencia), Espa√±a",
    "lat": 39.30864,
    "long": -0.41938
